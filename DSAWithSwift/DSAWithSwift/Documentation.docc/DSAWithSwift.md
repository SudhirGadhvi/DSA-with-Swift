# ``DSAWithSwift``

This project aims to provide learning resources and solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms using Swift programming language. It includes implementations of various DSA topics and solutions to LeetCode questions.

## Overview

This project serves as a learning platform for individuals interested in mastering DSA concepts using Swift. It provides detailed explanations, code examples, and solutions to LeetCode questions, helping learners understand and practice different DSA techniques.

## Topics

- <doc:TwoSum>

The TwoSum algorithm is a common problem in computer science and is often used as an example of a hash table application. Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
