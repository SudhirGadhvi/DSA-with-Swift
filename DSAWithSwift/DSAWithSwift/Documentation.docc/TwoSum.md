# TwoSum

## Overview

  The TwoSum algorithm is a common problem in computer science and is often used as an example of a hash table application. Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.
